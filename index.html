            <p class="alignLeft">Up in space, turning around, looking at the earth’s face. From that rock’s perspective on
                Mars or that gaz opinion from Jupiter, nothing cares about your problems. Up there, it’s just not serious,
                and there’s no such thing as an issue.
                Down here, the only reality is the one inside our brain. Nothing exists if the brain doesn’t think it.
                Nothing exists neither if our senses don’t transmit the message. That means that if we mis sense, our
                reality changes. That’s possible because
                our perception is limited : you can’t see at 360 degrees for example. If we mis translate the message, our
                reality changes. If we think it in a way, our reality changes depending on that way. Therefore, if we can
                change reality that much, everything’s fake.
                They’re proofs to that. Fall in love with someone and you’ll see that person as divine. Pull yourself out of
                that grip and the divine falls from clouds to solid ground, revealing him or herself differently. But the
                person is the same, you just changed your mind.
                Everything works like that : it’s not just that you can make your world, it’s that you passively do it
                anyway.

            <h1>The story</h1>

            <p>
                Once upon a time there was a Chinese farmer whose horse ran away. That evening, all of his neighbors came
                around to commiserate. They said, <span class="quote">“We are so sorry to hear your horse has run away. This
                    is most unfortunate.”</span> The farmer said, <span class="quote">“Is it <span class="good">good</span>?
                    Is it <span class="bad">bad</span>? I don't know.”</span> The next day the horse came back bringing
                seven wild horses with it, and in the evening everybody came back and said, <span class="quote">“Oh, isn’t
                    that lucky. What a great turn of events.
                    You now have eight horses!”</span> The farmer again said, <span class="quote">“Is it <span
                        class="good">good</span>? Is it <span class="bad">bad</span>? I don't know.”</span>
                The following day his son tried to break one of the horses, and while riding it, he was thrown and broke his
                leg. The neighbors then said, <span class="quote">“Oh dear, that’s too <span class="bad">bad</span>,”</span>
                and the farmer responded, <span class="quote">“Is it <span class="good">good</span>? Is it <span
                        class="bad">bad</span>? I don't know.”</span> The next day the conscription officers came around to
                conscript people into the army, and they rejected his son because he had a broken leg. Again all the
                neighbors came around and said, <span class="quote">“Isn’t that great!”</span> Again, he said, <span
                    class="quote">“Is it <span class="good">good</span>? Is it <span class="bad">bad</span>? I don't
                    know.”</span>
                The whole process of nature is an integrated process of immense complexity, and it’s really impossible to
                tell whether anything that happens in it is <span class="good">good</span> or <span class="bad">bad</span> —
                because you never know what will be the consequence of the misfortune; or, you never know what will be the
                consequences of <span class="good">good</span> fortune.
